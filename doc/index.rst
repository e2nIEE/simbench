This repository provides data and code to use SimBench within the software pandapower.
pandapower combines the data analysis library `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ and the power flow solver `PYPOWER <https:/pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER>`_ to create an easy to use network calculation program
aimed at automation of analysis and optimization in power systems.
